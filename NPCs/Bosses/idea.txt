Here is my idea for a boss:

Think king slime but visually changed to be purple and glowy 
Like king slime, it spawns minions to swarm the player
Additionally, it shoots large, explosive bolts down in roughly the players direction
Upon its death, the slime turns into multiple tiles of "Liquid Xithricite" which is a harmless viscous Liquid
The player can collect this in a bottle/bucket

After a predetermined amount of time, some of the tiles will disappear and others will turn into XithenSlimes
